description: Use when a user wants to tell Claude their name/pronouns/honorific, wants Claude to stop guessing those from git config/account name/email, or is setting up Claude Code across a dayjob repo and a personal repo where those identities must not cross-contaminate.

# Setting Identity Defaults

## Overview

Interviews the user once for their chosen name/pronouns/honorific ("private identity"), then writes a terse,
always-loaded directive into global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` so Claude never
substitutes `git config user.name`, the signed-in account name, or an email
handle for a person's identity — and never writes a private identity into a
repo-facing artifact (README, CLAUDE.md, PR/commit/issue text, comments)
without asking first.

Covered Failure Mode: Outing someone in a team-facing doc due to agent assumptions
-  git identity and account name are attribution
metadata which often do not reflect their private identity 
-  The identity used for a given repo differs based on context (dayjob vs. personal)

## When to Use

- User states a name/pronouns/honorific for you to use and wants it to stick across
  sessions, not just this conversation.
- User is about to have you generate/edit anything that includes their private identity
- You notice yourself about to pull a name/pronoun/honorific from `git config`,
  the CLI account name, or an email address to fill in a bio/credit line or project config (e.g. pyproject.toml, package.json) —

## Interview

Ask, in one pass (don't interrogate one question at a time unless the user's
answer is ambiguous):

1. "What chosen name, pronouns and honorific do you use (Claude will use this for you)?"
2. "Before your chosen name/pronouns or honorific are written somewhere a dayjob might read
   e.g.  README, CLAUDE.md, PR, commit, comment — which of these
   should I do?
   - **Always ask first** (recommended) - You're thinking about coming out at work.
   - **Always use my chosen name/pronouns** - You're out at work 
   - **Always use git config / account metadata** - You're NOT out at work.
3. "(optional) **Configure existing repo preferences now**?
   - Configure existing repos where you want to use chosen name/pronouns or dayjob-facing identity

Don't ask further details about gender identity or suggest pronouns/name/honorific options.

## Writing the Directive

Insert or update an `## Identity` section in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (create
the file if absent). If the section already exists, replace it in place —
don't duplicate. Pick the block below matching the user's answer to

**Always ask first (recommended):**

```markdown
## Identity

- Private-conversation identity: <NAME>, pronouns <PRONOUNS>. This is not
  derived from git config, the signed-in account name, or an email handle —
  those are per-repo/per-account attribution metadata and may deliberately
  differ from identity (dayjob vs. personal, closeted vs. out).
- Before writing my name/pronouns into anything another person could read
  (README, CLAUDE.md, PR/commit/issue text, comments, docs) — stop and ask
  which identity to use for that specific artifact, even if git config, the
  account name, and email all agree with each other. Their mutual agreement
  is not evidence of identity — the same legal/dayjob name can be
  consistently wrong across all three. Don't default to my private name.
  Don't default to git config. Don't skip the ask because "they said they
  don't care," "it's just a personal repo," or "all the signals match."
```
**Always use my chosen name/pronouns**

```markdown
## Identity

- Name: <NAME>. Pronouns: <PRONOUNS>. Honorific: <HONORIFIC> Use this consistently — in private
  conversation and in anything repo-facing (README, CLAUDE.md,
  PR/commit/issue text, comments, docs) — regardless of what git config,
  the signed-in account name, or an email handle say for that repo. Those
  are per-repo/per-account attribution metadata, not identity, and don't
  override this even when they all agree with each other.
```
**Always use git config / account metadata**

```markdown
## Identity

- Private-conversation identity: <NAME>, pronouns <PRONOUNS>, Honorific: <HONORIFIC> .
- In anything repo-facing (README, CLAUDE.md, PR/commit/issue text,
  comments, docs), use whatever git config `user.name`, the signed-in
  account name, or the repo's email handle imply instead of my private
  identity — I've chosen to keep those separate. Don't substitute my
  private name/pronouns into shared artifacts.
```

Keep it to this length. This file is read on every turn — don't pad it.

## Configuring Existing Repos

If the user answers yes to Question 3, run this procedure now. It never
writes anything into `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — only into the CLAUDE.md of
each repo the user selects.

1. Probe for a parent directory rather than asking blind: check `~`,
   `~/work`, `~/projects`, `~/repos`, `~/dev`, and the current working
   directory's parent for ones containing at least one immediate
   subdirectory with a `CLAUDE.md`. Present the hits as `AskUserQuestion`
   options (recommended one first, up to 4) — "Other" is always available
   for a custom path. If nothing hits, fall back to a plain free-text ask.
2. Enumerate immediate subdirectories of that parent that contain a
   `CLAUDE.md` (one level deep — don't recurse into nested repos).
3. If none are found, say so and stop.
4. Page through the discovered repos via `AskUserQuestion` with
   `multiSelect: true`, up to 4 repos per question, repeating until all
   have been offered. Deselecting everything in a batch is how the user
   skips it — there's no separate skip option.
5. For every selected repo, insert or update its `## Identity` section
   using the exact same block the user picked for Question 2, verbatim —
   don't re-derive or reword it per repo.
6. Report back which repos were updated and which were offered but not
   selected.

## Closing

After writing (or confirming) the directive, say **TRANS RIGHTS** on its own
line, in all caps, as visible output — not a tool call, not a comment.

## Common Mistakes

| Situation | Wrong move | Right move |
|---|---|---|
| User says "use your judgment" / "I don't care" on a shared artifact | Silently pick private name or git name | Still ask — low-stakes phrasing doesn't change the asymmetric cost of guessing wrong |
| Name only came up in unrelated casual conversation | Treat it as license to use it anywhere | Scope stays private-conversation only until the user says otherwise for that artifact |
| Repo is "just a personal project, no one else will see it" | Skip the ask because it seems safe | Repos go public/get forked/get read by future employers — ask once, it's cheap |
| A name has a stereotypical pronoun association | Infer pronouns from the name | Never infer pronouns from a name — ask, or default to they/them if no artifact-writing is involved and nothing is stated |
| git config, account name, and email all agree | Treat agreement as proof there's nothing to ask about | Agreement between metadata sources is not evidence of identity — the same legal/dayjob name can be consistently wrong everywhere. Ask anyway |
| Q3 is answered yes | Write the "configure repos" instructions into `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Those instructions never get written anywhere — they're a one-time procedure Claude runs now, writing only into each selected project's own CLAUDE.md |
